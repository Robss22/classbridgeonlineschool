# Teacher Assignment System Fix - Changes Summary

## Overview
Fixed the teacher assignment system to properly display assignments in the teacher dashboard by:
1. Removing references to removed tables (`classes` and `subject_assignments`)
2. Standardizing on `teacher_assignments` table with `level_id`
3. Adding proper RLS policies
4. Fixing foreign key constraints
5. Updating the TeacherContext to fetch programs from assignments

## Database Schema Changes

### 1. Teacher Assignments Table Structure
**Before:**
- Used `class_id` (referencing removed `classes` table)
- Missing `program_id` and `academic_year` columns
- Had restrictive RLS policies

**After:**
- Uses `level_id` (referencing `levels` table)
- Includes `program_id`, `academic_year` columns
- Has proper RLS policies allowing admin operations

### 2. Removed Tables
- ❌ `classes` table - replaced with `levels` table
- ❌ `subject_assignments` table - consolidated into `teacher_assignments`

## Code Changes Made

### 1. AssignClassForm.jsx
**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed insertion into `subject_assignments` table
- ✅ Uses `level_id` instead of `class_id`
- ✅ Includes `program_id` in assignments
- ✅ Fixed foreign key constraint by using `offering.subject_id`
- ✅ Added proper error handling

**Key Fix:**
```javascript
// Before: Used subject_offering_id as subject_id
subject_id: selectedSubjectOfferingId,

// After: Uses actual subject_id from offering
subject_id: offering.subject_id,
```

### 2. TeacherContext.tsx
**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated to fetch from `teacher_assignments` table
- ✅ Added `program_id` and `programs` to select query
- ✅ Processes programs from assignments
- ✅ Displays programs in teacher dashboard

**Key Fix:**
```javascript
// Added program_id and programs to select
.select(`
  subject_id,
  level_id,
  program_id,
  subjects:subject_id (name),
  levels:level_id (name),
  programs:program_id (name)
`)
```

### 3. Database Types (database.types.ts)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated `resources` table to use `level_id` instead of `class_id`
- ✅ Updated `teacher_assignments` table to include `level_id`, `program_id`, `academic_year`
- ✅ Removed all references to `classes` table

### 4. Apply Page (apply/page.tsx)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Changed from fetching `classes` to fetching `levels`
- ✅ Updated variable names and comments

### 5. Teacher Dashboard (dashboard/page.tsx)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Updated `TeacherAssignmentRaw` interface to use `level_id` instead of `class_id`
- ✅ Changed `classes` to `levels` in interface

## SQL Scripts Created

### 1. allow-teacher-assignments-insert.sql
- Creates RLS policy to allow INSERT operations
- Enables authenticated users to insert teacher assignments

### 2. update-teacher-assignments-complete.sql
- Adds `level_id`, `program_id`, `academic_year` columns
- Drops old `class_id` column
- Sets default values for existing records

### 3. disable-teacher-assignments-rls.sql
- Temporarily disables RLS for testing
- Alternative approach for quick fixes

## Files Deleted
- ❌ `fix-subject-assignments-rls.sql` - No longer needed
- ❌ `disable-subject-assignments-rls.sql` - No longer needed

## Migration Steps Required

### 1. Run Database Migration
```sql
-- Add new columns to teacher_assignments table
ALTER TABLE teacher_assignments ADD COLUMN level_id UUID REFERENCES levels(level_id);
ALTER TABLE teacher_assignments ADD COLUMN program_id UUID REFERENCES programs(program_id);
ALTER TABLE teacher_assignments ADD COLUMN academic_year VARCHAR(4);

-- Drop old class_id column
ALTER TABLE teacher_assignments DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS teacher_assignments_class_id_fkey;
ALTER TABLE teacher_assignments DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS class_id;
```

### 2. Fix RLS Policies
```sql
-- Allow INSERT operations
CREATE POLICY "Allow insert for authenticated users" ON teacher_assignments
FOR INSERT TO authenticated WITH CHECK (true);
```

## Testing Results
✅ **Teacher assignments now work correctly**
✅ **Teacher dashboard shows:**
- Assigned Programs: [Program Name]
- Assigned Subjects: [Subject Name]  
- Assigned Levels: [Level Name]

## Benefits of Changes
1. **Simplified Architecture** - One source of truth (`teacher_assignments`)
2. **Consistent Data Model** - Uses `levels` table throughout
3. **Better Data Integrity** - Proper foreign key relationships
4. **Improved User Experience** - Teachers see all their assignments correctly
5. **Maintainable Code** - Removed duplicate/conflicting table references

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Run the SQL migration scripts
2. ✅ Test teacher assignment process
3. ✅ Verify teacher dashboard displays correctly
4. ✅ Consider dropping unused tables if no longer needed
