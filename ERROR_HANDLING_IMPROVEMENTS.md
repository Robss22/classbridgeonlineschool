# Error Handling Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to error handling in the Class Bridge Online School application to provide user-friendly error messages instead of technical error details.

## Problem

Users were seeing technical error messages like:
- "Failed to fetch user profile: infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'users'. Please try again later or contact support."
- Raw database error messages
- Technical timeout and network error details

## Solution

### 1. Error Handler Utility (`utils/errorHandler.ts`)

Created a centralized error handling utility that:
- Maps technical errors to user-friendly messages
- Logs technical errors for debugging
- Provides consistent error messaging across the application

#### Key Functions:

- `getUserFriendlyErrorMessage(error)`: Converts any technical error to a user-friendly message
- `getAuthErrorMessage(error)`: Specifically handles authentication errors
- `logTechnicalError(error, context)`: Logs technical errors for debugging

#### Error Mappings:

| Technical Error | User-Friendly Message |
|----------------|----------------------|
| `infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "users"` | "We're having trouble loading user data right now. Please try again later. If the problem persists, contact us at info@classbridge.ac.ug" |
| `Failed to fetch user profile` | "We're having trouble loading user data right now. Please try again later. If the problem persists, contact us at info@classbridge.ac.ug" |
| `timeout` | "The request is taking longer than expected. Please check your internet connection and try again." |
| `network error` | "Network connection issue detected. Please check your internet connection and try again." |
| `Invalid login credentials` | "Invalid email or password. Please check your credentials and try again." |
| `Email not confirmed` | "Please check your email and confirm your account before logging in." |
| `Too many requests` | "Too many login attempts. Please wait a few minutes before trying again." |

### 2. Updated Components

#### Login Page (`app/login/page.tsx`)
- Replaced direct error message display with user-friendly messages
- Added technical error logging for debugging
- Improved error handling for authentication and profile fetching

#### AuthContext (`contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Updated all error handling to use the new utility
- Added proper error logging
- Improved user experience during authentication failures

#### StudentContext (`contexts/StudentContext.tsx`)
- Updated error handling for user profile fetching
- Added retry functionality with user-friendly error display
- Improved error UI with retry button

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Users see helpful, actionable error messages
2. **Consistent Messaging**: All errors follow the same format and tone
3. **Debugging Support**: Technical errors are still logged for developers
4. **Professional Appearance**: No more technical jargon in user-facing messages
5. **Contact Information**: Users know how to get help when needed

## Implementation Details

### Error Message Structure

All user-friendly error messages follow this pattern:
1. **Clear description** of what went wrong
2. **Actionable guidance** (e.g., "Please try again later")
3. **Contact information** for persistent issues (info@classbridge.ac.ug)

### Logging Strategy

Technical errors are logged with context information:
```typescript
logTechnicalError(error, 'Login Authentication');
```

This helps developers identify:
- Where the error occurred
- What operation was being performed
- The full technical error details

### Fallback Handling

For unknown errors, the system provides a generic but helpful message:
"We're experiencing technical difficulties. Please try again later. If the problem persists, contact us at info@classbridge.ac.ug"

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite (`utils/errorHandler.test.ts`) verifies that:
- All known error patterns are correctly mapped
- Unknown errors get appropriate fallback messages
- Authentication errors are handled specifically
- Null/undefined errors are handled gracefully

## Usage Examples

### Before (Technical Error)
```typescript
setError(`Failed to fetch user profile: ${profileError.message}. Please try again later or contact support.`);
```

### After (User-Friendly Error)
```typescript
logTechnicalError(profileError, 'Login Profile Fetch');
const userFriendlyMessage = getUserFriendlyErrorMessage(profileError);
setError(userFriendlyMessage);
```

## Maintenance

To add new error mappings:

1. Add the technical error pattern to `ERROR_MAPPINGS` in `utils/errorHandler.ts`
2. Write a user-friendly message following the established pattern
3. Add a test case to `utils/errorHandler.test.ts`
4. Update this documentation if needed

## Contact Information

For technical support or questions about error handling:
- Email: info@classbridge.ac.ug
- Technical errors are logged to the browser console for debugging
